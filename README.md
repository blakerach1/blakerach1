### About Me

In addition to my new found coding skills, I bring 10+ years of diverse professional experience, spanning the finance sector, public service, and most recently the construction industry in my role as Commercial Officer at <a href="https://www.landsurveys.net.au/" target="_blank">Land Surveys</a>

A high level of initiative and adaptability has allowed me to navigate through a variety of roles, where I've gained skills in project management, stakeholder collaboration and strategic problem solving.

I'm best known for my proactive approach, contribution as a team player and ability to take the lead to ensure the successful execution of critical tasks.

I have a passion for continous learning, and am consistently seeking opportunities to broaden my skill set.

Presently, I am in search of opportunities where I can apply my unique blend of experience and recently acquired coding skills, preferrably in software development and data-related projects.
