### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack junior developer at Racing & Wagering WA (RWWA).

I got my start after completing the 2023/24 She Codes Plus Program in Perth, Western Australia.

### About Me

Iâ€™m a junior full stack developer at Racing & Wagering WA (RWWA), where Iâ€™ve spent the past year upskilling rapidly across modern technologies including C#, TypeScript, React, and AWS. Our team works on RWWAâ€™s <a href="https://www.tabtouch.mobi/#" target="_blank">TABTouch product</a>, giving me hands-on experience across both backend and frontend development in a fast-paced, production-facing environment.

Before stepping into tech, I spent over 10 years in the finance sector, public service, and construction â€” most recently as a Commercial Officer at <a href="https://www.landsurveys.net.au/" target="_blank">Land Surveys</a>. This background gave me a solid foundation in project delivery, stakeholder communication, and strategic problem solving.

Iâ€™m known for being a proactive team player with strong initiative, and I'm deeply committed to continuous learning. Alongside my day job, I actively pursue extra-curricular projects and study with the goal of growing into a mid-level developer as soon as possible.

With roots in New Zealand, Iâ€™ve always loved the outdoors. These days I enjoy spending time outside with my partner and our little dog, and hosting friends for home-cooked meals â€” especially when Iâ€™m trying out new recipes.
